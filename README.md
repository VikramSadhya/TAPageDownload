# TAPageDownload
Python script to save the webpages of hotel listings from TA locally. It uses selenium and navigates through the pages by clicking the next button while saving them. This script can be run as a cron job to scrape the pages daily and save them in separate folders named by the date. The number of pages to be scraped can be specified by the variable page-limit and the start url can be changed to suit one's need.
